== README (Sample_App with errors)

This is supposed to be the sample doc being used with Michael Hart's railstutorialbook.org described in chapter 3.  However, I cannot get the code to work with heroku.  

It generates constatly the error:

* You must set config.secret_key_base in your app's config. 

* I have reinstalled numerous times now.

* I suspect it has something to do with the version control or something along those lines.
